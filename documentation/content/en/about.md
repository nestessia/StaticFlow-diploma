# What is StaticFlow

StaticFlow is a modern framework for generating fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites. It combines the best ideas from the world of static generators, CMS, and web frameworks to make the process of developing and publishing websites as simple and flexible as possible.

## StaticFlow is about static sites

StaticFlow generates completely static HTML files that can be hosted on any hosting service or CDN (such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Amazon S3, etc.). This means:

- No need for a server or database

- Maximum page loading speed

- High security (no server-side code vulnerabilities)

- Easy scaling and backup

## StaticFlow is about CMS

StaticFlow provides a convenient way to manage content through Markdown. You can:

- Separate website structure and content

- Use templates to automate formatting

- Make edits without programming knowledge

- Integrate editors and plugins to extend functionality
