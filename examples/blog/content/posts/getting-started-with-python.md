# Getting Started with Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity and readability. In this guide, we'll walk through everything you need to know to start programming with Python.

## Why Python?

Python has several advantages that make it an excellent choice for beginners:

1. **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is clear and intuitive
2. **Versatile**: Used in web development, data science, AI, and more
3. **Large Community**: Extensive libraries and resources available
4. **High Demand**: Many job opportunities for Python developers

## Installation

First, let's install Python on your system.

### Windows

1. Visit [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download the latest version
3. Run the installer
4. Check "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click Install

### macOS

```bash
brew install python
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## Your First Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this in a file named `hello.py` and run it:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Basic Concepts

### Variables

```python
# Numbers
age = 25
height = 1.75

# Strings
name = "John"
message = 'Hello!'

# Lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

### Control Flow

```python
# If statements
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# Loops
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
```

### Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    """Say hello to someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Using the function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
```

## Next Steps
